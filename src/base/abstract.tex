Students learn about the existence of the linking process, but few know and understand what it really does. The theoretical explanation often requires a good background in compilers and operating systems, but it can be easier to explain with a proper example that shows every change of the process. While the other available tools are not beginner friendly, ELF Detective is, and by using any binary files, even a personal ones that are well known for the user, it can thoroughly analyse and explain in an educational way the linking phase. This makes it a lot easier to understand without having a very good technical background. This is the tool to use for a more educational perspective of the linking stage.
